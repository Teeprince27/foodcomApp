# Food Com APP (Compose Multiplatform application)

Welcome to the documentation for the Jetpack Compose Multiplatform Food Com Application!
This is a cross-platform application that is built using Jetpack Compose Multiplatform. It includes shared business logic and data handling, and a shared UI implementation using Compose Multiplatform.
The application allows users to order food, make payments etc on Android, iOS.

## Next Features üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Obviously there would be more updates, What I am  working on these days?
- **Building the UI:** I am currently building the UI
#### **Future Plans:**
- **API integrations:** Soon I will be integrating with API

## Tech Stack üìö
- [Compose Multiplatform](https://jb.gg/compose) for UI
- [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) for networking
- [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for JSON handling
- [Kamel](https://github.com/Kamel-Media/Kamel) for image loading
- [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) for dependency injection
- [Voyager](https://github.com/adrielcafe/voyager) for navigation and screen models
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for image/videos/gif processing
- [Datastore](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/datastore) for storing data asynchronously, consistently, and transactional
- [Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest) for comprehensive testing tool
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) for performing concurrent operations with minimal overhead.

## Development üíª

My goal is to create a high-quality, multiplatform Food Com application that demonstrates the power and flexibility of Jetpack Compose.

## Challenges Faced üë®‚Äçüíª
During the development of this project,
I encountered and I am still encountering several challenges that required creative solutions.
Some of the key challenges I addressed include:

- **UI Testing:** Developing comprehensive UI tests across multiple platforms presented challenges in ensuring consistent behavior and visual presentation.
- **Unit Testing:** Writing unit tests for shared code and platform-specific implementations required careful consideration of differences in testing frameworks and environments.

These challenges underscored the complexity of developing a cross-platform Food Com application and pushed me to innovate and refine my solutions continually.

## Architecture üè¢
The Jetpack Compose Multiplatform Food Com Application is built using the Clean Architecture and the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern.

## Testing üß™
Testing is a crucial aspect of software development to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application.
In the Food Com project, I utilize various testing frameworks and tools to maintain the quality of my codebase.

<!--
### Android üì±

When Android is one of your targets, 
you can get the same experience for Android as if you were developing an Android app using Jetpack Compose.

-->
<!--
### IOS üì±
> iOS support is in Beta. It may change incompatibly and require manual migration in the future.

Compose Multiplatform shares most of its API with Jetpack Compose, the Android UI framework developed by Google. 
You can use the same APIs to build user interfaces for both Android and iOS.
